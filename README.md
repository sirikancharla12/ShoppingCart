
### **Shopping Cart System**

###  **Overview**

The **Shopping Cart System** is a console-based Java application designed to simulate basic e-commerce functionality. It allows users to browse products, add items to their cart, modify quantities, remove products, and proceed to checkout to view the final bill.

### **Key Highlights**

* Developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.
* Demonstrates core concepts like:

  * **Encapsulation** – Secure handling of product and cart data.
  * **Abstraction** – Simplified interaction through clear methods.
  * **Polymorphism** – Flexible operations for different product types or behaviors.
  * **Modularity** – Organized code structure for scalability and reusability.
* Provides an **interactive menu-driven interface** for smooth user experience.
* Focuses on **clean, maintainable, and reusable** Java code.

### **Purpose**

This project serves as a **practical implementation** of OOP concepts in Java, showcasing how structured programming can be applied to develop a simple yet functional shopping system. It’s ideal for students or beginners aiming to strengthen their understanding of Java classes, objects, and program flow in a real-world context.
